- Control virtual devices (network, disk)
- Toggle system settings (SSH, mDNS)
- Push hardware buttons (power, reset)
- Paste text via HID keyboard simulation
- Control OLED display settings
- Monitor and control mounted images
- **NEW**: Mouse jiggler control with multiple modes
- **NEW**: HDMI output control for PCI-E versions

## Troubleshooting

- If you can't connect to your NanoKVM device, make sure the IP address/hostname is correct and that the device is reachable from your Home Assistant instance.
- If authentication fails, verify your username and password.
- If entities are missing, try restarting Home Assistant.
- HDMI control is only available on PCI-E versions of the NanoKVM and will automatically be hidden for other hardware versions.
